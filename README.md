# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-ANN
Before dive into the project, Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. It measures how and why are customers leaving the business.
In this project we will make a customer churn prediction model using ANN(Artificial Neural Network). Here, we will build a deep learning model for churn prediction using telecom customer churn dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). Please find the project from the ".ipynb" file I have uploaded here.
